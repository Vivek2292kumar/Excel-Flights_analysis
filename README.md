# Flight Data Analysis (Excel Project)
## Overview
This project involves analyzing flight data using Microsoft Excel, focusing on understanding airports, airplanes, and flight operations. The datasets were merged and analyzed across different sheets to extract meaningful insights into flight patterns, airport efficiency, and aircraft performance.

## Dataset Details
Airports.csv – Contains details about different airports, including location and capacity.
Airplanes.csv – Includes aircraft specifications such as model, manufacturer, and seating capacity.
Flights.csv – Contains records of flight schedules, delays, and airline operations.
Key Analyses Performed
## 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Removed missing and duplicate values.
Standardized date and time formats for better analysis.
Merged datasets using unique identifiers like Airport ID and Aircraft Model.
## 2. Flight Performance Analysis
Identified busiest airports based on flight frequency.
Analyzed average flight delays by airport and airline.
Examined peak travel hours and most frequent routes.
## 3. Aircraft Utilization
Determined the most commonly used aircraft models for flights.
Compared aircraft seating capacity and flight frequency.
## 4. Airport Efficiency Analysis
Measured airport performance by on-time departures and delays.
Analyzed flight traffic trends by season and location.
## 5. Data Visualization
Created Pivot Tables & Charts for quick insights.
Used Conditional Formatting to highlight critical metrics.
Developed Trend Graphs to showcase seasonal variations in flight operations.

## Tools & Techniques Used
Microsoft Excel for data handling and visualization.
Pivot Tables & Charts for data summarization.
Lookup Functions (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) for merging datasets.
Statistical Functions (AVERAGE, COUNTIF, SUMIF) for deriving insights.

## How to Use the Excel File
Open the Excel file and navigate through different sheets.
Use filters and slicers to explore the data interactively.
Refer to the visualization dashboards for summarized insights.
Modify queries and calculations if needed for deeper analysis.
